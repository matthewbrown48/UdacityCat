The database should already be set up. 
If it is not, run the database_setup, and datapopulator files. this will create the itemsdb. 
1. start the Application.py file. 
2.navigate to http://localhost:5000/categories
This is the page for this site. I plan on later adding this to another website, that will be providing css and styling. 
From there you can navigate to a category, or logout. 
Fromt within a category, you can delete, edit, or add a new item, as well as return to the home page. 

the json endpoints are divided into an endpoint for the categories, an individual category, and items, 
rather than one endpoint that returns everything.
